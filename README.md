# Pokemon-Periodic-Table
This is a Pokémon Periodic Table, inspired by the periodic table of elements in chemistry which follows certain trends across the table. 

This site uses the retro Press Start 2P font for a nostalgic feel.

# Trends
1)Represent Pokémon types (e.g., Fire, Water, Grass, etc.).

2)Represent evolution stages:
Unevolved
First Evolution
Second Evolution

3)Base XP increases as you go down the table (↓).

4)Pokémon are grouped into columns based on their type (→).
