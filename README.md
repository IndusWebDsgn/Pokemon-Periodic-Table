# Pokemon-Periodic-Table
This is a Pokémon Periodic Table, inspired by the periodic table of elements in chemistry which follows certain trends across the table. 

This site uses the retro Press Start 2P font for a nostalgic feel.

# Trends

Represent evolution stages:
Unevolved
First Evolution

Base XP increases as you go down the table (↓).
Pokémon are grouped into columns based on their type (→).
